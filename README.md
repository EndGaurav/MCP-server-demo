# MCP server 

## Use claude desktop as your MCP client
- Since for transport i am using 'stdio' method that's why we need it to point to the file and that's what we wrote in config file. (Must read the config file)  
- first download the claude desktop.
- click on hamburger icon on the left-top location.
- go to 'file' -> 'settings' -> 'Developer' then load the config file.
- restart the claude program

## How to run file 
```
uv run mcp install main.py
```
